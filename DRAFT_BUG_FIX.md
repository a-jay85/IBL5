# Draft Module Bug Fix - Verification Document

## Bug Description
When users sorted the draft table by any column (e.g., by Name, Age, or stats), and then selected a player to draft, the system would incorrectly report that no player was selected.

## Root Cause
The HTML structure had the `<form>` element improperly nested inside the `<table>` element:
```html
<table class="sortable">
    <tr><th>...</th></tr>
    <form>
        <input type="hidden"...>
        <tr><td><input type="radio" name="player"></td></tr>
    </form>
</table>
```

This is invalid HTML. Browsers auto-correct this by moving the form element outside the table, which disconnects the radio buttons from the form. When the sorttable.js library then manipulates the DOM to sort rows, the broken structure causes form submissions to fail.

## Solution
Restructured the HTML so the form properly wraps the entire sortable table:
```html
<form>
    <input type="hidden"...>
    <table class="sortable">
        <tr><th>...</th></tr>
        <tr><td><input type="radio" name="player"></td></tr>
    </table>
    <input type="submit">
</form>
```

## Files Modified
1. `ibl5/modules/College_Scouting/index.php` - Fixed HTML structure (lines 72-200)

## Expected Behavior After Fix
Users can now:
1. View the draft table
2. Sort by any column (Name, Position, Age, stats, etc.)
3. Select a player using the radio button
4. Click "Draft" button
5. Successfully draft the selected player

The fix ensures the form-input relationship is maintained regardless of how JavaScript reorders the table rows.

## Validation Steps
To manually verify the fix works:
1. Log in as a team with an active draft pick
2. Navigate to the College Scouting / Draft module
3. Click on any column header to sort the table (e.g., sort by "Name")
4. Select a player using the radio button
5. Click the "Draft" button
6. Verify the player is successfully drafted (no "player not selected" error)

## Technical Details
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No database changes required
- No changes to business logic
- Only HTML structure improved to be standards-compliant
- Works with all modern browsers
- Compatible with sorttable.js library
