# Free Agency Test Suite - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive PHPUnit test suite for the IBL5 Free Agency module, covering all aspects of free agency functionality including offer validation, processing, display, and end-to-end workflows.

## Implementation Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 47 tests (reduced from initial 70 by removing redundant tests)
- **Total Assertions**: 100+ assertions
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~2,100 lines (reduced from ~2,600)
- **Test Files**: 4 test classes + 1 README + 1 Summary
- **All Tests Pass**: ✅ 100% pass rate

## Test Suite Structure

### 1. FreeAgencyOfferValidationTest.php (16 tests, 38 assertions)

Tests core validation rules from `freeagentoffer.php`:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Zero contract amount validation
- ✅ Veteran minimum validation by experience level
- ✅ Bird Rights handling (reset on team change, retained on same team)
- ✅ Raise validation (10% without Bird rights, 12.5% with Bird rights)
- ✅ Salary decrease prevention
- ✅ Soft cap validation
- ✅ Hard cap validation (cannot exceed)
- ✅ Maximum contract validation (25%, 30%, 35% by experience)
- ✅ Already signed player validation
- ✅ MLE offer amounts (1-6 years: $450K-$675K)
- ✅ LLE offer amounts ($145K)
- ✅ Veteran minimum offer amounts ($52K-$117K by experience)

### 2. FreeAgencyOfferProcessingTest.php (8 tests, 16 assertions)

Tests business logic calculations:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Loyalty modifier calculation (±2.5% per point)
- ✅ Security modifier calculation (contract length based)
- ✅ Playing time modifier calculation (position salary based)
- ✅ Winner modifier calculation (0.0153% per W-L point)
- ✅ Tradition modifier calculation (0.0153% per tradition W-L point)
- ✅ Millions committed at position (capped at $2000K)

### 3. FreeAgencyModuleDisplayTest.php (14 tests, 31 assertions)

Tests display logic from `modules/Free_Agency/index.php`:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Free agent identification (draft_year + exp + cyt - cy = current_year)
- ✅ Pipe-prefixed player exclusion from roster spots
- ✅ Soft cap space calculation (uses League::SOFT_CAP_MAX = $5,000K)
- ✅ Hard cap space calculation (uses League::HARD_CAP_MAX = $7,000K)
- ✅ Cap space with offers included
- ✅ Future salary calculations by contract year (cy 0-5)
- ✅ Veteran minimum by experience ($52K-$117K)
- ✅ Maximum contract by experience (25%-35% of League::SOFT_CAP_MAX)
- ✅ Player demand display (undrafted rookies: years 3-4 only)

### 4. FreeAgencyIntegrationTest.php (9 tests, 26 assertions)

Tests complete end-to-end workflows:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Complete offer submission workflow
- ✅ Offer amendment workflow (delete + new offer)
- ✅ Offer deletion workflow
- ✅ Multiple teams offering same player
- ✅ MLE offer workflow (4-year MLE example)
- ✅ Bird Rights workflow (over soft cap with 3+ Bird years)
- ✅ Invalid offer rejection (excessive raises)
- ✅ Hard cap enforcement
- ✅ Perceived value calculation in complete workflow

## Business Rules Validated

### Validation Rules
1. **Zero Amounts**: Year 1 cannot be zero
2. **Veteran Minimum**: Experience-based minimum enforced
3. **Bird Rights**: Transfer with player, reset on team change
4. **Raises**: 10% max (non-Bird), 12.5% max (Bird)
5. **Decreases**: Not allowed (except to zero)
6. **Soft Cap**: $5,500K (can exceed with Bird rights/MLE/LLE)
7. **Hard Cap**: $7,500K (cannot exceed)
8. **Max Contract**: 25%-35% of soft cap by experience
9. **Already Signed**: cy=0 AND cy1!=0 prevents offers

### Processing Rules
1. **Offer Creation**: INSERT into ibl_fa_offers
2. **Offer Amendment**: DELETE + INSERT
3. **Offer Deletion**: DELETE from ibl_fa_offers
4. **Modifiers**: 5 factors (loyalty, winner, tradition, security, playing time)
5. **Perceived Value**: average × (1 + modifiers) × random
6. **Discord**: Notifications for offers >$145K when enabled

### Display Rules
1. **Free Agent**: draft_year + exp + cyt - cy = current_year
2. **Roster Spots**: 15 - (players + offers), exclude pipe-prefixed
3. **Cap Space**: Soft/Hard cap minus committed salaries
4. **Future Salaries**: Based on current contract year (cy)
5. **Vet Min**: $52K-$117K by experience level
6. **Max Contract**: $1,375K-$1,925K by experience level

### Special Cases
1. **MLE**: $450K-$675K escalating, 1-6 years, can exceed soft cap
2. **LLE**: $145K, 1 year, can exceed soft cap
3. **Vet Min**: Experience-based, 1 year, can exceed soft cap
4. **Rookies**: 2-year max, demands shown for years 3-4 (quirk)

## Test Organization

### Groups for Targeted Testing
- `@group validation` - All validation tests
- `@group processing` - All processing tests
- `@group display` - All display tests
- `@group integration` - All integration tests
- Plus 20+ sub-groups for specific features

### Running Tests
```bash
# All Free Agency tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/FreeAgency/

# Specific test file
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/FreeAgency/FreeAgencyOfferValidationTest.php

# By group
./vendor/bin/phpunit --group validation
./vendor/bin/phpunit --group bird-rights
./vendor/bin/phpunit --group mle
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ All tests pass (47/47 = 100%)
- ✅ Clear test names describing what is tested
- ✅ Comprehensive assertions (100+ total)
- ✅ Uses production constants (League::SOFT_CAP_MAX, League::HARD_CAP_MAX)
- ✅ Mock database for isolation
- ✅ Follows Extension test suite patterns
- ✅ Well-documented with comments
- ✅ Organized with test groups
- ✅ Comprehensive README documentation
- ✅ Tests focus on business logic, not mock behavior

## Files Created

1. `tests/FreeAgency/FreeAgencyOfferValidationTest.php` (683 lines)
2. `tests/FreeAgency/FreeAgencyOfferProcessingTest.php` (625 lines)
3. `tests/FreeAgency/FreeAgencyModuleDisplayTest.php` (636 lines)
4. `tests/FreeAgency/FreeAgencyIntegrationTest.php` (649 lines)
5. `tests/FreeAgency/README.md` (263 lines)
6. Updated `phpunit.xml` to include Free Agency test suite

## Future Refactoring Support

These tests are designed to support a future refactoring that would extract:

1. **FreeAgency\OfferValidator** - Validation logic
2. **FreeAgency\ModifierCalculator** - Modifier calculations
3. **FreeAgency\DatabaseOperations** - Database operations
4. **FreeAgency\DisplayHelper** - Display logic
5. **FreeAgency\OfferProcessor** - Orchestration

The tests validate current procedural code but are structured to easily adapt to object-oriented refactoring.

## Testing Methodology

- **Mock Database**: Uses MockDatabase from tests/bootstrap.php
- **No Real Database**: All tests run without database connection
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent
- **Assertions**: Multiple assertions per test for thorough validation
- **Coverage**: Every business rule has at least one test
- **Edge Cases**: Tests include boundary conditions and special cases

## Integration with Repository

- ✅ All 167 repository tests pass (Free Agency + Extension + Trading)
- ✅ No conflicts with existing tests
- ✅ Follows established patterns from Extension tests
- ✅ Uses existing MockDatabase infrastructure
- ✅ Properly integrated into phpunit.xml

## Success Metrics

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All core business rules tested
✅ **High Quality**: 100% pass rate, well-documented
✅ **Lean & Focused**: Tests validate business logic, not mock behavior
✅ **Production Data**: Uses League constants instead of hardcoded values
✅ **Maintainable**: Clear structure, organized groups
✅ **Refactoring Ready**: Supports future OOP refactoring
✅ **Integration**: Works with existing test infrastructure

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented a comprehensive, production-ready PHPUnit test suite for the Free Agency module that:
- Validates all core business rules
- Tests all workflows end-to-end
- Uses production constants (League::SOFT_CAP_MAX, League::HARD_CAP_MAX)
- Focuses on business logic, not mock behavior
- Maintains 100% test pass rate (47 tests, 100+ assertions)
- Removed 23 redundant tests that tested mock behavior or simple arithmetic
- Provides detailed documentation

The test suite is ready for use in verifying Free Agency functionality after refactoring efforts.
