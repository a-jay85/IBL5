# Copilot Coding Agent Instructions for IBL5

## Overview
This repository uses the Copilot coding agent to automate code changes, improvements, and maintenance. Please follow these best practices to ensure smooth collaboration and effective automation.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Clear, Actionable Pull Request Titles
- Start PR titles with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Refactor", "Update").
- Be concise but descriptive (e.g., "Fix player stats calculation bug").

### 2. Write Descriptive Pull Request Descriptions
- Clearly explain the purpose and context of the change.
- List any related issues or tickets.
- Include testing or validation steps if relevant.

### 3. Keep Pull Requests Focused
- Each PR should address a single logical change or feature.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one PR.

### 4. Use Conventional Commits (Optional)
- If possible, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.

### 5. Review and Approve PRs Promptly
- Review Copilot-generated PRs for correctness and style.
- Leave feedback or request changes as needed.
- Approve and merge when ready.

### 6. Document Special Requirements
- If your repo has special coding standards, review processes, or deployment steps, document them here.
