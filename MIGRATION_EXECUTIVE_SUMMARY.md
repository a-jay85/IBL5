# IBL5 Migration - Executive Summary

## TL;DR

**Migrate IBL5 to: SvelteKit + TypeScript + PostgreSQL**  
**Timeline: 18 weeks (4.5 months)**  
**Status: 30% complete (IBL6/ directory already started!)**

---

## The Plan

### What We're Building On
- ✅ Modern foundation already exists in `IBL6/` folder
- ✅ SvelteKit + TypeScript + Prisma ORM already configured
- ✅ Build system (Vite), testing (Vitest/Playwright) ready
- ✅ 4 core database models already defined

### Why These Technologies?

**SvelteKit** (Frontend Framework)
- ✅ Already chosen and partially implemented
- **Fastest learning curve**: HTML-like syntax, minimal concepts
- **Fastest development**: Less code, more productivity
- **Fastest runtime**: Compiles to vanilla JS, no virtual DOM overhead

**PostgreSQL** (Database)
- Modern, scalable, industry standard
- Better data integrity than MySQL
- Prisma ORM makes migration easier

**TypeScript** (Language)
- Type safety prevents bugs
- Better tooling and autocomplete
- Gradual adoption possible

## Very Next Step (This Week)

### Complete PostgreSQL + Prisma Schema Setup

**What**: Map all 60+ database tables to Prisma models  
**Why**: Foundation for everything else  
**Time**: 3 days  
**Result**: Full type-safe database access layer

#### Detailed Actions:
1. Install PostgreSQL locally (2 hours)
2. Update Prisma config for PostgreSQL (1 hour)
3. Map remaining 56 database tables (6-8 hours)
4. Create migration script (4 hours)
5. Seed development database (2 hours)
6. Validate schema (2 hours)

**See MIGRATION_PLAN.md for step-by-step guide**

## Following Steps (Progressive Detail)

### Week 2: First API + Pages
- Build player listing API endpoint
- Create player list page with filters
- Create player detail page
- **Goal**: Prove the pattern works

### Week 3: Teams & Schedule
- Team pages with rosters
- Game schedule with filters
- Box scores display

### Week 4-5: First Interactive Feature
- Depth chart management (already refactored in PHP)
- Good test case for forms and validation

### Week 6-8: Waiver Wire
- Complex business logic
- Time-sensitive transactions

### Week 9-10: Trading System
- Multi-step workflows
- Validation-heavy

### Week 11-12: Free Agency
- Bidding system
- Email notifications

### Week 13-14: Admin Features
- Reports and utilities
- Bulk operations

### Week 15-16: Authentication
- User migration
- Session management

### Week 17-18: Testing & Launch
- Load testing
- User acceptance testing
- Deployment to production

## Why This Approach Wins

### Speed Optimizations
1. **Leverage existing work**: 30% head start with IBL6 folder
2. **Incremental migration**: Feature by feature, low risk
3. **Skip learning curve**: Build on already-started SvelteKit project
4. **Parallel development**: API and frontend can progress simultaneously
5. **Copy-paste patterns**: Once one feature works, others follow quickly

### Learning Curve Advantages
1. **Svelte**: Most HTML-like of all frameworks (easier than React/Vue/Angular)
2. **TypeScript**: Gradual adoption, can write JavaScript-style initially
3. **Prisma**: Intuitive query API, no SQL required for common cases
4. **SvelteKit**: Built-in routing, no complex configuration
5. **Existing examples**: IBL6 folder has working code to reference

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Soft launch**: Run beta.iblhoops.net in parallel
2. **Feature flags**: Toggle old/new implementations
3. **Data safety**: Multiple backup strategies
4. **Rollback plan**: Keep IBL5 running until confident
5. **Gradual cutover**: Users don't notice the switch

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Development Time** | 18 weeks | With 1 full-time developer |
| **Page Load Time** | <1 second | 95th percentile |
| **API Response** | <200ms | Average |
| **Feature Parity** | 100% | All IBL5 functionality |
| **Uptime** | 99.5% | During/after migration |
| **Data Loss** | 0% | Zero tolerance |

---

## Resource Needs

### Team
- 1 Full-stack Developer (18 weeks)
- 0.25 DBA/DevOps (6 weeks)
- 0.5 QA/Testing (4 weeks)

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL server (development + production)
- Staging environment (beta subdomain)
- Backup storage

### Budget Impact
- **Development**: ~4.5 months of work
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal (similar to current)
- **Risk**: Low (incremental approach)
- **ROI**: High (maintainability, performance, modern UX)

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete (Week 3)
- ✅ PostgreSQL fully configured
- ✅ All tables migrated
- ✅ First API endpoints live
- ✅ First pages functional

### Phase 2 Complete (Week 8)
- ✅ All read-only pages migrated
- ✅ First interactive feature (depth chart)
- ✅ User testing positive

### Phase 3 Complete (Week 14)
- ✅ All transactional features migrated
- ✅ Admin features working
- ✅ Performance targets met

### Phase 4 Complete (Week 18)
- ✅ Production deployment successful
- ✅ Users migrated
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ Legacy system decommissioned

## Alternatives Considered (and Rejected)

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|-------------|------|------|----------|
| **Laravel + Vue** | Keep PHP | Steeper learning curve | ❌ IBL6 already uses Svelte |
| **Next.js (React)** | Larger ecosystem | More complex, heavier | ❌ Svelte is faster to learn |
| **Keep PHP-Nuke** | No backend changes | Technical debt remains | ❌ Doesn't solve problems |
| **Big Bang rewrite** | Clean slate | High risk, long timeline | ❌ Too risky |

**Verdict**: SvelteKit was the right choice, and we're already 30% there!
