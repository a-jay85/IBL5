# IBL5 Database Guide

## Quick Reference

### ⚠️ SCHEMA VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT
**Always reference `ibl5/migrations/000_baseline_schema.sql` (and subsequent migrations) for table/column names and relationships.** Never assume database structures exist without verification. This prevents hallucination of non-existent tables.

### Current Status
- **93 Base Tables** (all InnoDB) + **27 Views**
- **Foreign Keys:** 33 constraints implemented
- **Indexes:** 447+ (including primary keys)
- **API Ready:** ✅ Complete (Timestamps, UUIDs, Views)

### Key Tables
- **Players:** `ibl_plr` (main), `ibl_hist` (VIEW over `ibl_plr_snapshots`)
- **Teams:** `ibl_team_info`, `ibl_standings`
- **Games:** `ibl_schedule`, `ibl_box_scores`, `ibl_box_scores_teams`
- **Contracts:** `ibl_fa_offers`, `ibl_trade_*` tables
- **Draft:** `ibl_draft`, `ibl_draft_picks`

## Schema Location
- **Baseline:** `/ibl5/migrations/000_baseline_schema.sql` (production snapshot)
- **Migrations:** `/ibl5/migrations/` (001+ alter the baseline)

## Database Architecture

### Engine Status
- **InnoDB Tables (93):** All base tables — ACID transactions, row-level locking
- **Views (27):** Computed views replacing denormalized tables (stats, win/loss, awards, franchise history)

### API-Ready Features ✅
1. **Timestamps:** 19 tables have `created_at`, `updated_at` for caching/ETags
2. **UUIDs:** 5 critical tables (players, teams, games, etc.) for secure public IDs
3. **Views:** 27 database views replacing denormalized tables and optimizing API queries
   - `vw_player_current` - Current season player data
   - `vw_team_standings` - Real-time standings
   - `vw_team_awards` - All team awards (Div/Conf/Lottery from `ibl_team_awards`, IBL Champions from `vw_playoff_series_results`, HEAT Champions from `ibl_box_scores_teams`)
   - `vw_franchise_summary` - All-time wins/losses/winpct/playoffs/titles per team
   - `vw_playoff_series_results` - Playoff series outcomes derived from box scores
   - `vw_current_salary` - Salary resolution (replaces CASE pattern)
   - `vw_career_totals` - Regular season career totals
   - `vw_series_records` - Head-to-head records
   - Plus 15 additional views for stats, win/loss, and schedule data

### Foreign Key Relationships (33)
Core data integrity constraints implemented:
- `ibl_hist.pid` → `ibl_plr.pid`
- `ibl_draft_picks.tid` → `ibl_team_info.teamid`
- `ibl_box_scores.gameid` → `ibl_schedule.Date`
- And 30 more... (see `000_baseline_schema.sql` for complete list)

## Best Practices

### For Queries
- Use prepared statements with mysqli or PDO
- Reference `000_baseline_schema.sql` for table structures
- Leverage existing indexes for WHERE/JOIN clauses
- Use database views for complex API queries

### For Migrations
- Place all migrations in `/ibl5/migrations/`
- Use numbered prefixes (e.g., `003_my_migration.sql`)
- Test on development database first
- Never modify production schema directly

### For API Development
- Use UUIDs for all public identifiers
- Implement ETags using `updated_at` timestamps
- Query database views instead of joining multiple tables
- Follow REST best practices (see API_GUIDE.md)

### For Refactoring Validation
- **Always verify refactored code against production (iblhoops.net)**
- Compare database queries and output between localhost and production
- Ensure query results return identical data (same rows, same order, same values)
- Check that data transformations produce identical output
- If results don't match exactly, refactoring is not complete
- Use database tools (e.g., query comparison, row diffing) to identify discrepancies
- This prevents unintended behavior changes from refactoring

## Character Sets & Collation
- **Legacy tables:** latin1_swedish_ci (PhpNuke)
- **Modern tables:** utf8mb4_unicode_ci (Laravel, new features)
- **Recommendation:** Gradually migrate to utf8mb4 for international support

## Performance Notes
- InnoDB conversion provided 10-100x improvement on concurrent operations
- Composite indexes provide 5-25x speedup on multi-column queries
- Row-level locking enables API concurrency without bottlenecks

## Table Categories

### IBL Core Tables (`ibl_*` prefix)
- **Player Data:** plr (main), hist (VIEW over plr_snapshots)
- **Statistics:** *_stats, *_career_avgs, *_career_totals (multiple seasons)
- **Games:** schedule, box_scores, box_scores_teams
- **Team Management:** team_info, standings (team_history dropped Feb 2026, replaced by `vw_franchise_summary` and `vw_team_awards` views)
- **Operations:** draft, fa_offers, trade_* tables
- **Awards/Voting:** awards, votes_ASG, votes_EOY

### PhpNuke Legacy (`nuke_*` prefix)
- **CMS:** stories, stories_cat, topics, blocks, config, counter, stats_*
- **Status:** Being retired; 10 tables remain (see STRATEGIC_PRIORITIES.md Section 1)

### Auth Tables
- **`auth_users`:** Authentication (email, password, username, roles)
- **User-to-team mapping:** `ibl_team_info.gm_username`

## Common Query Patterns

### Get Player with Current Stats
```php
$query = "SELECT p.*, h.* FROM ibl_plr p 
          LEFT JOIN ibl_hist h ON p.pid = h.pid 
          WHERE p.pid = ? AND h.year = ?";
```

### Team Roster
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM ibl_plr 
          WHERE tid = ? 
          ORDER BY ordinal";
```

### Using Database Views (API)
```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM vw_player_current WHERE uuid = ?";
```

## Migration History

- **Phase 2 (Nov 2, 2025):** Foreign key constraints ✅
- **Phase 3 (Nov 4, 2025):** API preparation (timestamps, UUIDs, views) ✅
- **Migration 026 (Feb 2026):** Created `vw_playoff_series_results` view ✅
- **Migration 027 (Feb 2026):** Replaced win/loss tables with computed views ✅
- **Migration 028 (Feb 2026):** Replaced 9 stats tables with computed views ✅
- **Migration 030 (Feb 2026):** Dropped `ibl_team_history`, created `vw_team_awards` and `vw_franchise_summary` views ✅

## Opaque Column Glossary

Every column below carries a SQL `COMMENT` in `ibl5/migrations/000_baseline_schema.sql`; this section is the human-discoverable index over those comments, not a duplication of them.

### ibl_plr Rating Columns (4.14)

The backlog item originally listed 6 rating columns (`oo`, `od`, `dd`, `po`, `pd`, `td`); `ibl_plr` actually has **8** — `do` (Drive offense) and `to` (Transition offense) are equally opaque and documented here for completeness. All are `tinyint` on a 1–5 scale. The sibling `r_*` columns use the expanded naming convention.

| Column | Meaning | `PlayerData.php` property |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| `oo` | Outside offense rating | `ratingOutsideOffense` |
| `od` | Outside defense rating | `ratingOutsideDefense` |
| `do` | Drive offense rating | `ratingDriveOffense` |
| `dd` | Drive defense rating | `ratingDriveDefense` |
| `po` | Post offense rating | `ratingPostOffense` |
| `pd` | Post defense rating | `ratingPostDefense` |
| `to` | Transition offense rating | `ratingTransitionOffense` |
| `td` | Transition defense rating | `ratingTransitionDefense` |

Source: `ibl5/classes/Player/PlayerData.php`.

### Contract-Year Columns (4.15)

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `cy` | Current contract year — `0` = unsigned, `1`–`6` = year number |
| `cyt` | Contract total years — `1`–`6` |

ADR-0010 Tier 4 explicitly excluded these columns from the snake_case rename sweep.

### Single-Word Domain Columns (4.16)

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `bird` | Consecutive years with team for Bird Rights eligibility (nullable) |
| `exp` | Years of NBA experience — **not** "expiring contract"; `exp` = experience |

### Stat Prefix Groups (4.17)

Consumed by `ibl5/classes/Player/Stats/PlayerStats.php`. The prefixes follow a `<scope>_<stat>` convention:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `sh_*` | Season high | `sh_pts` |
| `sp_*` | Playoff season high | `sp_pts` |
| `ch_*` | Career high — **not** "championship"; `ch_` = career high | `ch_pts` |
| `cp_*` | Career playoff high | `cp_pts` |
| `s_dd` | Season double doubles | — |
| `s_td` | Season triple doubles | — |
| `c_dd` | Career double doubles | — |
| `c_td` | Career triple doubles | — |

Depth-chart codes (`dc_of`, `dc_df`, `dc_oi`, `dc_di`, `dc_bh`) are documented in `ibl5/docs/JSB_FILE_FORMATS.md`.
